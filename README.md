# Access-Control-System
This repository contains the project I worked on during my final year as an undergraduate. The whole system is based on Face Recognition technology and Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) as a tool for the proper identification of users. It allows two-step authentication of users to grant access to authorized users only. The components used for the implementation of this system are; Raspberry pi 3, RFID reader, Passive Infrared Sensor, Pi Camera, and solenoid lock. 
With this technology, usersâ€™ faces are detected, captured, and matched with the face image saved on the database and will only grant access to such users if the face matches what is present on the database. Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) Library was used detect and recognize faces.
